# PoC_EmployeeManagerFE

This is a PoC project made to research how the communication works within a full-stack application. For this project I've followed [this workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx4iBLKLVHk) to get familiar with full-stack development. This is the front-end part of the PoC. For the back-end, go [here](https://github.com/rmzhen/PoC_EmployeeManager).

Due to unclear instructions from the timestamp 1:40:23 with code not being the same as the code snippets being used as templates, this PoC has been left as unfinished.
